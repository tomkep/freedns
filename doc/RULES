			XName Software developpement guidelines


I - CVS access

No anonymous CVS access is available at this time.
It's not for confidentiality reasons or something like that,
just because of a lazy admin.
If you wish to have a read-only CVS access, just send an email
with your ssh dsa public key attached to xname@xname.org.

CVS write access will be granted for active developpers.
Before having writable access, you can submit patches on the dev
mailing list, xnamesoft-dev@xname.org.


II - Patch submission

o) database modification

Any database modification has to be included in bin/migrate*.pl, to
let other xname-engin users migrate their own database, and to
be ported into sql/creation.sql.


a) New functionality.

If you wish to see your new functionality in XName soft, ask first
about it on xnamesoft-dev mailing list, and open a "bug" as feature
on http://source.xname.org/bugs/


 i - Doc

doc/yourfile.txt has to explain what is your new functionality,
how to enable/disable it, and how to use it.

If additional libraries, software or config modification are needed
to run your new functionality, you have to write a doc about it, and
disable it by default - explaining in the config file where the doc
is.


 ii - web interface

to say it simple, all has to be inside classes.
All has to be configurable using html/libs/config.php.

Remind that XName interface has to be used by "basic" users, which
just know what basic records are - NS, MX, A - and for some of them, CNAME.
Every new functionality on the web interface has to be explained on it,
and all "advanced" feature has to be on the advanced interface.


 iii - perl scripts

all new perl script has to be included in bin/scheduler.pl, with it's
run delay variable in bin/config.pl.


b) bug correction.

submit patch done using diff -u with one or two comment lines
to xnamesoft-dev mailing list.
